### Creative Briefs

Prepare 3–5 distinct creatives to test. Here are three high-performing concepts.

—

**1) UGC Testimonial (0:20–0:30, 1080x1920)**
- Hook (2–3s): State the problem or surprising result.
- Story (10–15s): Why you tried it, what changed, 1–2 key benefits.
- Proof (5–8s): Close-up demo or before/after. Overlay rating/badge.
- CTA (2–3s): "Try [Product] — risk-free. Link in ad."
- On-screen text: large, high-contrast captions.

Shot list: selfie A-roll, product closeups, B-roll using product, packaging.

**2) Problem → Solution Demo (0:15–0:25, 1080x1080/1920)**
- Frame 1–2: Problem visually.
- Frame 3–5: Show product solving it; simple mechanism.
- Frame 6–7: 3 benefits as overlays.
- Final: Offer and CTA.

Asset needs: clean background, brand colors, readable overlays, end card.
