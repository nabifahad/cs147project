### Campaign Strategy: Facebook & Instagram

**Goal**: Drive profitable conversions from cold and warm audiences on Facebook and Instagram.

**Primary Objective**: Sales (Conversions). Alternative: Leads (Lead Generation) if you rely on native forms.

**Offer**: Clearly articulate a single, compelling offer (price, bonus, guarantee). Keep it consistent across ads and landing pages.

**Messaging Angles**:
- **Problem → Solution**: Agitate the core pain, resolve with your solution.
- **Social Proof**: Testimonials, ratings, press logos.
- **Risk Reversal**: Guarantees, free trials, easy returns.
- **Authority**: Founder POV, expert endorsements, UGC credibility.
- **Value Stack**: What’s included, before/after, unique mechanism.

**Structure**:
- **Campaign**: 1 per objective (e.g., Sales).
- **Ad Sets**: 3-5 per campaign targeting distinct audiences.
- **Ads**: 3-6 per ad set mixing formats (image, video, carousel) and messages.

**Audience Hypotheses**:
- Broad: Country-level, 21-55, Advantage+ placements, no interests.
- Interest 1-2: 2-3 tightly grouped interests related to category.
- Lookalike: 1% based on high-quality seed (purchasers, leads, engagers).
- Warm: Website visitors 30-180 days, IG/Facebook engagers 365 days.

**Budgets**:
- Start: $20–$50/day per ad set. Scale winning ad sets by 20–30% every 2–3 days.
- If limited budget: 1–2 ad sets at $20/day; rotate creatives.

**Optimization**:
- Conversion location: Website (Pixel/Conversions API). Event: Purchase or Lead.
- Optimization window: 7-day click (default) unless short decision cycles.
- Placements: Start with Advantage+ placements unless brand constraints require manual.

**KPIs/Guardrails**:
- CTR (link): 0.8%+ for cold. CPC: context-dependent, target within industry norms.
- CPA/CPP: Set target based on LTV and margins. Kill ads 2–3x target CPA after 1,000–2,000 impressions without signals.
- MER/ROAS: Evaluate at campaign level; don’t overfit to single ad metrics.

**Testing Plan (First 7–10 days)**:
1. Launch 3–4 ad sets (Broad, Interest, Lookalike, Warm if available).
2. In each, test 3–5 creatives covering different angles.
3. Kill bottom performers after statistically meaningful spend. Keep 2–3 winners.
4. Duplicate winners into other ad sets to validate generalizability.

**Creative Matrix (Angles x Formats)**:
- UGC Testimonial (video, square)
- Problem → Solution Demo (video, vertical)
- Before/After Carousel (image, carousel)
- Founder Story (video, square)
- Offer Value Stack (image, square)

**Landing Page Alignment**:
- Match headline, imagery, and offer across ads and LP.
- Ensure fast load, above-the-fold CTA, social proof near CTA.

**Compliance**:
- Avoid personal attributes, prohibited content, and misleading claims.
- Use compliant language, especially for special categories (Housing, Employment, Credit, Issues/Elections/Politics).
